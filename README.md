# BookStore Console Application

This simple Java console application consists of three classes - `BookStoreWindowIO`, `Book`, and `BookStoreWindow`. Together, they allow users to manage a bookstore by performing various operations. The application provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the program. Below is an overview of each class:

## `BookStoreWindowIO` Class:

This class contains the main method and user interface for the bookstore application. It allows users to interact with the program through a menu-driven console interface. Users can set the name of the bookstore, read book information from a CSV file, print a summary of the bookstore, and get statistics on the books.

## `Book` Class:

This class represents the `Book` object with fields such as `id`, `title`, `year`, and `value`. It includes a constructor to initialize the book, getter methods for accessing the fields, and a `toString` method to provide a formatted representation of the book.

## `BookStoreWindow` Class:

This class represents the bookstore window and includes fields for storing a collection of books and the name of the bookstore. It has methods for adding books to the collection, retrieving the bookstore name, setting the bookstore name, finding the highest value and oldest books, and calculating the average value of all books.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Compile and run the `BookStoreWindowIO` class.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the menu.
3. Choose the desired options to manage the bookstore.

## Notes:

- The program uses a CSV file named 'books.csv' to input book information.
- Certain options may have prerequisites or conditions, so follow the on-screen instructions accordingly.
- An easter egg is hidden within the program. Can you find it?

## Getting Started:

Ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone or download the repository, and then run the `BookStoreWindowIO` class.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code as needed!
